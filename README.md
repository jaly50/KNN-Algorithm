# KNN-Algorithm
KNN part &amp; reports for Data Mining task 11

1. Please put your train and test data under the project directory  (example: project/testProdIntro.binary.arff)
2. Please put all codes under project/src/task11 directory
3. Please run Test.java to get all answers for selection and introduction
4. We define the weight and similarity in Test.java, and it pass to KNN as parameter of double[], double[][]


File introduction:
	Vector.java is instance, it represents each records
	
	DataSet.java represents an arff file, it stores attributes, attributes value list, instances, whether an attribute is discrete
	
	CrossValidation.java: To get accuracy of cross validation
